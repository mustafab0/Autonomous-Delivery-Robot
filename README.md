# propeller_project
Line follower bot in a grid environment using the propeller microcontroller board. Project 2 of Advanced Mechatronics

Since a major part of the project was to use two devices together we decided to break our solution into two halves and assign each device to perform a specific task. The following is how we broke down the solution.
